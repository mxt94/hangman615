# Hangman
Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.

This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it. 

Within this project I will show the skills I have learnt so far during my course to build a hangman model that allows a user to guess words from a list of words within a certain amount of attempts. The model will be eror proof to ensure smoothness where a user tries to complete the game
